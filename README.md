#Assignment 3

In this assignment, I first created a new branch.  Next, I added a new question which involved the user guessing a number.  Then I created some code which added up the number of questions the user got correct.  Finding the best method to do this was the most challenging task for me.  Overall, I found this exercise to be very straightforward and simple.

-Today we added a third column to Nicholle's page. We also made it so that her prompts ask questions. The answers the user submits are displayed on the table on the top of her page. It will display green if it is correct and red if it is incorrect. We also added a background color, font family and text color.

#Class #2 Assignment

In this assignment I made the following changes:
- I added a count for the number of correct responses the user got.
- I also made it so that the user can enter an answer in lower or uppercase and it will still count it as correct if the answer is correct. I used Jon Duckett's book "Javascript & JQuery" pages 128-130 to assist me with this.
- I also made changes to the fourth question which evaluates whether or not the answer is too high or too low.

1. The programming went very well. I was able to use my resources, which are great when you know how to use them. The books are incredibly helpful, but it is nice to be able to speak with the instructor and TAs to help validate or redirect my thoughts on the assignments or code.
2. The most difficult part of the assignment was the git part. However, after going over it with someone and finding a list of basic git commands online, I was able to figure it out. I went through editing, adding, committing and pushing several times to help familiarize myself with it.
3. The easiest part of the assignment was the actual coding. The reading and coding assignments have been introduced in a way that is easy for me to learn and grasp while also challenging me.

   Today we added functions to Abby's page as well as took away all the alerts, working on the functions was a bit difficult and seemed a bit redundant for this particular page but I could see where functions would come in handy for other projects.
   Also the whole forking repositories and making a new branch for myself to keep her code in so I am able to save the changes I have made into that branch was hard to understand at first.
