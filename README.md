#Class #2 Assignment

In this assignment I made the following changes:
- I added a count for the number of correct responses the user got.
- I also made it so that the user can enter an answer in lower or uppercase and it will still count it as correct if the answer is correct. I used Jon Duckett's book "Javascript & JQuery" pages 128-130 to assist me with this.
- I also made changes to the fourth question which evaluates whether or not the answer is too high or too low.
